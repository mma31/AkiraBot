## What I can do

### Twitter Interact

If you need someone to talk to on Twitter, I'm there! I respond to mentions and to direct messages.

[Visit my Twitter profile]("https://twitter.com/AkiraChatBot") and ask me something.

Mention eg: "**@AkiraChatBot How are you today?**"

### Personality Lookup

I can give you details about almost any personality, fictional or not. But only if you ask me nicely!

Eg: "**Who was Albert Einstein?**", "**Who is Austin Powers?**", "**Who were The Powerpuff Girls?**", "**Who are The Beatles?**"

### Event Search

Want to go to an event somewhere? You can ask me that too and I'll lookup some events for you. But you need to promise that you'll send pics!

Eg: "**What events are in Washington today?**", "**What events are in Rome this week?**", "**What is happening in Hiroshima next week?**"

### URL Screenshot

I can also take screenshots of links you give me and I'll show them to you just as I finish. Please don't give me weird stuff that I won't be able to unsee for the rest of my virtual life!

Eg: "**Show me http://akirabot.ml/**", "**Browsershot http://akirabot.ml/**"
